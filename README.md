# CentOS-7-to-8
Upgrade script for CentOS upgrade from 7 to 8

There is no guarentee whatsoever witht this script.

This appears to work well with minimal server install. I have limited ability to test thoroughly but so far has worked well. It does present a probme in a GUI environment. I am working on this to further it's ability to update a GUI as well. Fell free to post any updates you make.
