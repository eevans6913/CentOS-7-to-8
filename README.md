# CentOS-7-to-8
Upgrade script for CentOS from 7 to 8

There is no guarentee whatsoever with this script.

This appears to work well with minimal server install excluding added poackages, (ie bind, smb, etc.). I have limited ability to test thoroughly but so far has worked well. It does present a problems in a GUI environment. I am working on this to further it's ability to update a GUI as well. Fell free to post any updates you make.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO UPGRADE CENTOS 7 WITH A GUI. IT WILL FAIL.
